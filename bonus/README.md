## Bonus Assignment: Clustering

**15 bonus points**

In this assignment, you will implement k-means clustering to cluster together a sample of user descriptions from Twitter. (I apologize for any offensive text you may be subjected to.) These are a somewhat random sample of 10,000 user profiles. They have already been tokenized.

1. Implement the functions as indicated in `cluster.py`
  - `cluster`
  - `compute_means`
  - `compute_clusters`
  - `distance`
  - `error`
  - `print_top_docs`
  - `prune_terms`
2. You can use `test.txt` to help debugging -- there should be 3 clear clusters (a, b, c).
3. Your output should match that in [Log.txt](Log.txt).

For reference, my implementation takes < 30s to run, so you should be around there.
