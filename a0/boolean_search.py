""" Assignment 0

You will implement a simple in-memory boolean search engine over the jokes
from http://web.hawkesnest.net/~jthens/laffytaffy/.

The documents are read from documents.txt.
The queries to be processed are read from queries.txt.

Your search engine will only need to support AND queries. A multi-word query
is assumed to be an AND of the words. E.g., the query "why because" should be
processed as "why AND because."

    3. Intersect the postings list of each word in the query.

    If a query term is not in the index, then an empty list should be returned.
